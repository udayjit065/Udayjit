# Udayjit

Full Stack AI Engineer | Machine Learning Systems Builder | Product Engineer at 360labs  

I design, build, and deploy production-grade AI systems end-to-end — from data pipelines and model training to scalable APIs and full stack intelligent applications.

My work focuses on transforming machine learning models into reliable, real-world products that operate under production constraints.

Current focus areas:
- AI-powered product engineering  
- Semantic search and retrieval architectures  
- Production ML deployment and model serving  
- Scalable full stack systems
